A series of language models based on [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai)'s [video series](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=dJprQlzr0Sazt8UC) on [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore).

Currently, I have implemented the Bigram language model (manually with frequency counts, and with a basic neural network to incrementally learn the distribution).
